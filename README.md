Task Manager :
The student chooses the task-manager bot to ask/look at his/her task assigned for the day. The next day, the student has to tell if he/she has completed the task. If no, then they have to state the valid reason. If yes, he/she gets another task. She/he can also enter doubts in the bot or have an appointment fixed with the concerned teacher.
